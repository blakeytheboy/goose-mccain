            <p class="bio2">Hi! I'm Blake Andrews! I'm the game director for Goose McCain! A lot of the things I do often revolve around film and game design. I love to make short films, and even have a knack for photography! Most of my knowledge of the game's industry stems from a course I did during high school, and own personal accomplishments. A couple of my favourite films are The Lighthouse and Eternal Sunshine, and a couple of my favourite games are Minecraft and Red Dead 2. Main updates and announcements will be done from this site so please feel free to stick around!</p>
