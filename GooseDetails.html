            <p>I wrote and directed the initial reveal trailer for my game ‘Goose McCain’ which features an animated adaptation of what the full game will look like. The trailer is light storytelling to tease audiences about the overall narrative in this game, while also featuring some light gameplay to show what the end product will inevitably look like.

            <p id="leftC">The studio is Blorgan Ind., a company founded by Morgan Shea and myself (Blake Andrews). I currently occupy the roles of game animator, writer, and director for Goose McCain. Later projects may see me return to those roles, or I may lend them to someone else in the company. I worked on the creation of initial Goose McCain teaser trailer and poster as a solo team member, while I'm currently sourcing funds and development collaborations while I'm slowly working away at it from home. Art style is like a paint brush on artwork, while the trailer doesn’t explicitly show this, the background teases the end result. This is a personal choice I made to help characters and action stand out more and contrast the background. The design phase took 10 weeks to develop with constant bouncing of ideas and concepts between co-workers to help begin a story that hasn’t been told before.

            <p id="rightC">The budget was a light $50,000 which was primarily spent on the hiring of animators and gameplay designers. As well as the purchasing of computers, and licensing for Adobe products. The game will be available at E3 along with a short playable demo. The software used was Photoshop, Illustrator and Adobe Animate. These are used for concept art and the creation of the initial reveal trailer. However we are also using Unreal Engine 4 for the actual game. After putting in research into what engines we could use, we leaned more towards Unreal Engine as it felt more accessible for the gameplay developers and had more free range when it comes to hiring people for the project. The game is planned to be about 25-40 hours long, with something for completionists and casuals to look forward to. Also look forward to a few fun surprises along the way. *wink* </p>

            <p>The game will be available at E3 along with a short playable demo with a tease at the content coming later on. The release date is currently slated for the fall of 2023, however there is no confirmation because we're still looking for more devs, and who knows. We usually come up with ideas along the way. The game can be played on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and PC as of the time of writing this.</p>
