            <p>Goose McCain is a hack and slash beat-em-up style game in the same vein as Bayonetta and Kingdom Hearts. The game depicts a character by the name of 'Goose McCain' escaping a facility and trying to come to terms with his past actions. The game takes place in prior memories as you explore his apartment, featuring the hack and slash style everyone loves, and then quick time/stealth missions in the present day.</p>
